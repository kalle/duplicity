	- Allow an empty passphrase for signing key
	- Make clear in the verification prompt whether the encryption passphrase
	or the signing passphrase is being confirmed

2011-06-11  Lekensteyn  <lekensteyn@gmail.com>

	- invalid function description fixed for get_passphrase in duplicity-bin
	- function get_passphrase in duplicity-bin accepts argument "for_signing"
	which indicates that a passphrase for a signing key is requested
	- introduces the SIGN_PASSPHRASE environment variable for passing a
	different passphrase to the signing key
	- commandline option --encrypt-secret-keyring=path introduced to set a
	custom location for the secret keyring used by the encryption key
	- manual page updated with SIGN_PASSPHRASE and --encrypt-secret-keyring
	- ask for a new passphrase if the passphrase confirmation failed to
	prevent an endless retype
	- improved some comments in the code
	- due to the difference in the handling of the signing and encryption
	passphrase, the passphrase is asked later in the duplicity-bin

	merge of lp:~scode/duplicity/ignore-errors

2009-07-04  Peter Schuller  <peter.schuller@infidyne.com>

	* support an --ignore-errors command which is intended to mean "try to continue in the face of" errors
	that might possibly be okay to ignore
	- intended during restoration to avoid bailing out on errors that are not fatal yet would in fact
	produce an "incorrect" restoration
	- for now, only changes behavior on file meta data restoration where I happened to have a problem
	(I had a +t file which was impossible to restore to +t even though it was possible for it to
	exist and for me to read it)
	- be clear in the man page that this is only supposed to be used in case of problems and even then
	to please contact maintainer if use is needed

	Changes for 0.6.01.

2009-07-01  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

	Fixed issues in Checkpoint/Restart:
	* The --name backupname" option was added to allow the
	user to separate one archive from another.  If not
	specified, the default is an MD5 hash of the target
	URL, which should suffice for most uses.
	
	* The archive_dir (cache) is now stored in a standard
	location, defaulting to ~/.cache/duplicity.  See
	http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/
	
	* The interaction between the --archive-dir option and
	the --name option allows for four possible results
	for the location of the archive dir.
	- neither specified (default)
	~/.cache/duplicity/hash-of-url
	- --archive-dir=~/arch, no --name
	~/arch/hash-of-url
	- no --archive-dir, --name=foo
	~/.cache/duplicity/foo
	- --archive-dir=~/arch, --name=foo
	~/arch/foo
	
	* duplicity will now copy needed metadata from the
	remote store to the local cache as needed.  This
	means that the first use after upgraded from 0.5.x
	will have the metadata copied to the local archive
	dir in order to sync both.
	
	* cleanup will now work correctly with the archive
	dir and separates the local from the remote files.

2009-06-27  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

2009-06-22  Peter Schuller  <peter.schuller@infidyne.com>

	* outstanding issue: in order to figure out which arg is a backend we call get_backend();

	is side-effect free

2009-06-22  Peter Schuller  <peter.schuller@infidyne.com>

	* introduce --name parameter to specify symbolic name of a backup
	* change --archive-dir expansion to look for %DUPLICITY_BACKUP_NAME%
	* which in turn defaults to the args hash previously used for

2009-06-16  Peter Schuller  <peter.schuller@infidyne.com>

	* significantly re-design the asynch scheduler to be much simpler; instead of keeping workers
	and queues, simply launch a thread for each unit of work, blocking when called for by
	a concurrency limit or a barrier. the old design was a result of initially designing for
	keeping a persistent set of workers, only to then drop that idea. when dropping that idea,
	I should have re-done it like this from the start instead of retaining the complexity
	i introduced for the persistent worker design.

	Revert to calling NcFTP utilities (ls, get, put) directly
	rather than scripting ncftp via pexpect.  Move fatal error
	regarding version 3.2.0 to a warning message since it has
	been reported that the segfault problem does not occur on
	most distributions.

	bug #22908: Don't block gpg-agent
	https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?22908
	
	To fix the above, --use-agent was added as a command line option.
	When this is specified and asymetric encryption is enabled, then all
	GnuPG passphrases will come from the gpg-agent or equivalent program
	and no passphrase prompt will be issued.

	bug #25853: duplicity fails with boto passwords coming from ~/.boto
	https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?25853

2009-03-15  loafman

	GPG errors will no longer cause tracebacks, but will produce a
	log entry, from gpg, similar to the following:
	===== Begin GnuPG log =====
	gpg: BAD0BAD0: skipped: public key not found
	gpg: [stdin]: encryption failed: public key not found
	===== End GnuPG log =====
	This will let the user know what really caused the GPG process
	to fail, and what really caused errors like 'broken pipe'.

	Fixed issue with Pure-FTPd that would always return an empty

2007-11-19  loafman

2007-08-13  loafman

	Do not pass :port part of URL to scp backend.
	Its taken as the target file and errors out.

2007-08-13  loafman

	Change ssh_command option to be ssh_options.  This adds
	options to the scp and sftp commands that are used by
	the ssh backend.

2007-08-13  loafman

	Fixed bug 20764 - unable to use port in ssh backend.
	https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?20764
	
	Change ssh backend to send 'quit' instead of EOF when
	using sftp.  This allows it to run under cron as long
	as the password is supplied non-interactively.

2007-08-09  loafman

	Changes for 0.4.3.RC12

2007-08-09  loafman

	Changes for 0.4.3.RC12

2007-08-09  loafman

	Changed the file:, ftp:, and ssh: backends so that
	the target directory will be created at start.
	
	Changed the ftp: backend so that empty target dirs
	do not error out.

2007-08-09  loafman

	Clean up help list formatting.

2007-08-09  loafman

	Fix index out of range in Bug 20730, triggered when there

	https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?20730

2007-08-09  loafman

	- Fix author and maintainer settings.

2007-08-09  loafman

	Fix environment var name for ssh backend.

2007-07-21  loafman

	Changes for 0.4.3.RC11.

2007-07-21  loafman

	Add --ssh-askpass option.

2007-07-21  loafman

	Duplicity now correctly processes scp URL's of the form:
	scp://user@host[:port]/
	where the directory spec is empty.  This fixes a bug where the
	user could not write into the home directory on the target.
	
	The SSH/SCP backend has had an overhaul.  It now requires the
	python-pexpect module.  Normally this can be obtained from your
	distro's repository, but if you want, you can download pexpect
	from http://pexpect.sourceforge.net.
	
	The SSH/SCP backend work was done to allow the user to use password
	authentication rather than public-key.  You may now enter a password,
	either through the FTP_PASSWORD environment variable, or at the
	console.  To activate this feature you will need to use the option
	--ssh-askpass on the command line.  The default is public-key, which
	does *not* look for a password from either source.

2007-07-15  loafman

	patch #6094, Boto Backend Fixes for RC10

2007-07-14  loafman

	Changes for 0.4.3.RC10

2007-07-14  loafman

	Add support for:
	--ftp-passive,
	--ftp-regular,
	--num-retries
	
	Removed -m option on FTP put command.  This means that
	the remote directory must exist prior to backup.
	
	Changed ftpBackend from -f option back to commandline.
	Various versions of ncftp* interact differently when
	both -f and commandline options are supplied.
	
	The FTP password is munged in all log operations.
	
	Added logging of filenames in the bucket when -v9 is
	used on Amazon S3.

2007-07-14  loafman

	Add support for:
	--ftp-passive,
	--ftp-regular,
	--num-retries

2007-07-14  loafman

2007-07-09  loafman

	Changes for 0.4.3.RC9.

2007-07-09  loafman

	Added a commandline option, '--num-retries=<int>', to set the number
	of retries.  The default is 5.

2007-07-09  loafman

	New S3 backend, Boto, from Eric Evans, replaces bitBucket.  Boto can
	be obtained from http://code.google.com/p/boto/.  I did not make this
	a requirement for setup since its not in the normal repositories.
	
	New FTP backend from Thorsten Schnebeck that uses ncftp instead of
	Pythons ftplib.  This seems to be much more solid.  I added the -f
	option with a secure temp file to contain host, user, and password,
	rather than having them on the command line.  I also added the -m
	option to the put command to create the target directory and the -t
	option to make sure it times out if there is a network problem.
	
	The Backend class now contains a popen_persist function that acts like
	run_command_persist.  Both use the new num_retries global.

2007-06-29  loafman

	Change to a max block size of 2048 bytes for
	rsync difference buffer.  This may slow things
	down for truly large files, but will give much
	smaller deltas on files with numerous small
	changes, such as database files.

2007-06-28  loafman

	Initial release.

2007-06-27  loafman

	Changes for 0.4.3.RC8

2007-06-27  loafman

	Bug 20039 - Andreas Schildbach: --and--
	Patch 6030 - Alexander Zangerl <az@debian.org>:
	Duplicity now uses bzip2 for compression.  This matches the way
	the Debian distribution handles it.  I'll think about adding an
	option to override later, if its needed.

2007-06-27  loafman

	Bug 20282 - Thomas Tuttle:
	An out of range index when checking past history in the backup
	sets caused a failure when trying to access later.
	
	Bug 20149 - dAniel hAhler:
	dAniel submitted a second patch for this for further cleanup.
	The new patch prefers the latest intact backup set.

2007-06-19  loafman

	Changes for 0.4.3.RC7

2007-06-19  loafman

	Patch 6029 - Alexander Zangerl <az@debian.org>:
	http://bugs.debian.org/370206
	archive-dir together with incremental backup results in crash. the
	patch is simple, the code in 0.4.2 did attempt to access strings as
	objects.

2007-06-19  loafman

	Patch 6033 - Alexander Zangerl <az@debian.org>:
	let's add a --help terse usage message and don't just direct the user
	to the manual. this should come handy if somebody needs to restore
	stuff without having the manual available.

2007-06-19  loafman

	Patch 6032 - Alexander Zangerl <az@debian.org>:
	a new feature patch: i've recently gotten annoyed with having gazillions of
	5mb files and therefore added a --volsize option to allow the user setting
	the chunk size. the patch is simple and contains a manpage update as well.

2007-06-19  loafman

	Add -u (unbuffered) to shebang line.

2007-06-19  loafman

	reset and try again.

2007-06-13  loafman

	Not needed.

2007-06-13  loafman

	Cosmetic change to force new log.  The log for revision 1.28

	incrementally more robust for recovery.

2007-06-13  loafman

2007-06-13  loafman

	Patch 5998 - Kuang-che Wu: Cache uid and gid lookup to speed
	operations.

2007-06-13  loafman

	Bug 20419 - dAniel hAhler: When errors cause an incomplete backup set,
	flag the error with a message, rather than erroring out.  The user
	then knows to run --cleanup.

2007-06-04  loafman

	Changes for 0.4.3.RC5.

2007-06-04  loafman

	dAniel hAhler submitted a patch to change "Error initializing file
	foo" (log level 2), where foo was a socket, to "Skipping socket foo"
	(log level 7).  https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?5985

2007-06-04  loafman

	Change logging to flush after every write, unbuffering stdout and
	stderr, thus producing logs that are coherent.

2007-06-04  loafman

	* Implement a suggestion by Ben Escoto to move the access and secret keys to
	environment variables.
	* Implement a very simplistic error correction mechanisim that will re-connect
	on an operation failure and re-try the operation. Note that this is just a
	band-aid for issues that should be resolved at lower levels.
