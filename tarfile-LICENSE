-----------------------------------------------------------------
      tarfile    - python module for accessing TAR archives

                   Lars Gustäbel <lars@gustaebel.de>
-----------------------------------------------------------------


Description
-----------

The tarfile module provides a set of functions for accessing  TAR
format archives. Because  it is written  in pure Python,  it does
not require any platform specific functions. GZIP  compressed TAR
archives are seamlessly supported.


Requirements
------------

tarfile needs at least Python version 2.2.
(For a tarfile for Python 1.5.2 take a look on the webpage.)


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
IMPORTANT NOTE (*NIX only)
--------------------------

The addition of character and block devices is enabled by a C
extension module (_tarfile.c), because Python does not yet
provide the major() and minor() macros.
Currently Linux and FreeBSD are implemented. If your OS is not
supported, then please send me a patch.
